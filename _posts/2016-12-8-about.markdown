"There are only two questions really worth asking. Why are we here? And what should we do about it while we are?" <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_lloyd_inventories_the_invisible" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">John Lloyd</a>.

I have no idea why we are here. But I want to merge my background in astrophysics and particle physics to observe and model the universe. I am obsessed with physics and I want to inspire the next generation. Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Hawai'i and a collaborator on <a href="https://lbnf-dune.fnal.gov/how-it-works/introduction/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">DUNE</a>.

## Neutrinos (and Dark Matter)

Neutrinos are one of the basic constituents, or Lego bricks, making up matter.
They are everywhere - trillions, departing from the Sun, go through us every second and hundreds per cubic centimeter are left over from the Big Bang. Neutrinos changes protons to neutrons, power nuclear fusion in stars, and create elements that make planets and living organisms. They are astronomical beacons, streaming from the guts of the stars and perhaps yet unknown astrophysical objects. Also, neutrinos could be the key to understanding the origin of mass and the predominance of matter over antimatter in our universe.
In short, neutrinos are profoundly important, but don’t take it form me - look at the Nobel Prizes in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2015. Neutrinos can show things that cannot be seen in any other way. And yet, Nature tantalizes us, since neutrinos are nearly undetectable.

They are *almost* noninteracting and *almost* massless.
This is very different from all other fundamental particles. 
We still cannot figure out why neutrinos are almost, but not quite, massless. 
Nor, do we know the values of their masses (aside from an upper limit set at a million times smaller than the mass of an electron). 
But, we do know why they are almost noninteracting. 
They do not participate in electromagnetic or strong interactions that bind atoms and nuclei. 
Rather, only the aptly named weak force and gravity. In fact, neutrinos are the *only* part of dark matter that we understand. 

If you thought that was weird, it gets weirder. 
There are three, almost identical, stable flavors of neutrinos, and they change into one other. 
This only happens if: neutrinos have mass, those masses are different for different types, and  neutrinos of definite flavors are quantum superpositions of neutrinos of definite mass (aka “neutrino mixing”). 

In the twentieth century, most scientists did not expect this. 
Very few devoted their time to neutrinos - the almost imaginary particles. 
However, following the discovery of neutrino mixing, a quantum effect, on terrestrial and astronomical distance scales, a flurry of neutrino research followed in the 21st century. 

We will, undoubtedly, learn more about neutrinos over the next decade.  
Current neutrino telescopes are already seeing extragalactic neutrinos and next-generation neutrino detectors currently under construction will extend multi-messenger astronomy and study the differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos in an attempt to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.

I am interested in advancing our understanding of neutrinos and dark matter, and in searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model, which may be accessible through neutrino & DM experiments. DUNE is one of the detectors that can answer these questions. It is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) - a marvel of cryogenic and electric engineering. LArTPCs take unprecedented resolution ‘pictures’ of particle interactions that allow for precision neutrino physics. Currently, my research focuses on calibrating LArTPCs and developing new algorithms for the reconstruction of particle interaction ‘images’.
