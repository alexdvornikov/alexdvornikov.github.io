"There are only two questions really worth asking. Why are we here? And what should we do about it while we are?" <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_lloyd_inventories_the_invisible">John Lloyd</a>.

I have no idea why we are here. But I want to merge my background in astrophysics and particle physics to observe and model the universe. I am obsessed with physics and I want to inspire the next generation. Ultimately, I want to be a professor. Presently, I'm a PhD student at the University of Hawaii and a collaborator on <a href="https://lbnf-dune.fnal.gov/how-it-works/introduction/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">DUNE</a>. Before joining DUNE, I modeled <a href ="/assets/MS_Thesis.pdf" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">sterile neutrinos</a> in the early universe.
