Faculty Evaluations
<hr/> Alex is definitely one of the best teachers I could've asked for. He offered his help so much and
provided us with a lot of feedback and made us feel comfortable with not knowing and coming
forward in asking questions. He'd try and explain in many different ways to
make sure we understood. One of the best teachers ever.
<hr/> Alex is great instructor!! Very helpful and makes sure we all understand the lesson. He's very
patient and never gets tired of all my stupid questions. I love that!
Alex was incredibly helpful and the labs weren't too difficult or confusing. It was a great
course.
