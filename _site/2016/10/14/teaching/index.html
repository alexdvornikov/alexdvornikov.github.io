    <p>Faculty Evaluations (SFSU &amp; SDSU)</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is definitely one of the best teachers I could’ve asked for. He offered his help so much and
provided us with a lot of feedback and made us feel comfortable with not knowing and coming
forward in asking questions. He’d try and explain in many different ways to
make sure we understood. One of the best teachers ever.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is great instructor!! Very helpful and makes sure we all understand the lesson. He’s very
patient and never gets tired of all my stupid questions. I love that!
Alex was incredibly helpful and the labs weren’t too difficult or confusing. It was a great
course.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2015_Spring_2.JPG" alt="Pic1" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is very helpful and very caring. My group was usually the last one to finish and passed the class time. He would wait for us to finish the lab and never complained about waiting.</p>
<hr />
<p>He’s understanding, helps us learn, makes sure we understand everything, and he’s cute! I had no
clue that was how he spelled his name (Olexiy). Great lab prof :)</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was passionate about the subject and teaching.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is absolutely wonderful. He’s very helpful, friendly, and flexible.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is a very smart teacher. He explained concepts not simply related to
the class and made abstract ideas as simple as possible. His passion for physics shows in his teaching.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was very nice and approachable and answered our questions warmly. His grading was very fair.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex extensively helped in and out of class.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2016_Fall_2.JPG" alt="Pic2" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Amazing lab instructor. Really knowledgeable, kind, funny, and cares about his students.</p>
<hr />
<p>Would definitely take a class with Alex again! He made class enjoyable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Super nice, always grades fairly, tells us exactly what to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is engaging and very interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was great for his first time teaching. Physics is very complex and he
taught to the best of his abilities.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2016_Fall_3.JPG" alt="Pic3" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Honestly one of the best TA’s, I wish he’d teach Summer Session 2!! Great guy. I liked
how he always asked us what we learned in lecture so he could help us brush up the subject.</p>
<hr />
<p>I had a good time. Alex did a very good job of explaining and helping us with very complicated and hard to understand lab instructions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex tried his best to help. He is extremely smart and I wouldn’t have understood many parts of the labs without him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is a great. He’s willing to answer all and any questions, even if he already answered them. He’s very patient and explains in detail so that it’s understandable for all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex grades fast and explains the concepts thoroughly.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2015_Fall_3.JPG" alt="Pic4" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is a great TA. Very helpful. He helped students whenever they were struggling and provided his own examples and experiences to help us understand the concepts. I’m not good at physics, but I learned more in this hands on lab.</p>
<hr />
<p>Great teacher; passionate and knowledgeable; very helpful; showed concern for all his students.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was very enthusiastic in helping us learn and creating a fun environment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is great. Very kind and helpful.</p>

questions and help with the lab!</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2014_Fall_3.JPG" alt="Pic5" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex effectively taught me and the rest of the students how to do some of the more
ambiguous aspects of certain labs. He is a skillful instructor that seems to genuinely care about
teaching us. He is the best lab instructor I’ve ever had.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was able to explain material that was un-comprehensible to his students very clearly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was friendly, helpful, and available for office hours.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex helps us a lot during the lab. He gives mini lectures so we know what we are doing. He is amazing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is pleasant and great.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2015_Fall_2.JPG" alt="Pic6" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was very approachable, patient, and always answered any questions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex definitely helped me a lot! Since our lab was on a Monday, we hardly touched the lab
subjects in lecture so he would go over the main concepts.</p>
<hr />
<p>He was a nice teacher and helped especially when we needed it. He often stayed overtime and waited for us to finish.</p>
<hr />
<p>This class was very enjoyable. Although the concepts were tough, Alex always explained
everything clearly.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2016_Spring_1.JPG" alt="Pic7" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>He’s very good at helping his student understand the subject.</p>
<hr />
<p>This course was challenging on certain days, but I loved it. Alex was very helpful and
explained every lab thoroughly before continuing. He went around the room to help anyone
who had questions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Great at simplifying and explaining the relevance of the lab performed. Patient, able to deal with all personalities.
Useful office hours.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex was a great teacher and was very patient in explaining the complexities of physics. He’s the best physics lab instructor ever. Helped so much and was always available. Really wanted students to succeed.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2016_Spring_2.JPG" alt="Pic8" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/images/2016_Summer_2.JPG" alt="Pic10" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Alex is a super cool guy who advanced my knowledge of physics. When he’d explain things, they often went over my head since he went about them in a different way than I did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Great teacher; took time to answer all our questions; very helpful.</p>
<hr />
<p>He’s a fantastic instructor. Friendly, receptive, extremely knowledgeable.</p>
<hr />
<p>He clearly knows his stuff. Alex is an amazing teacher and helped me work through any blocks. I really appreciated that he made physics not scary!</p>

        <p>Hey, there. I’m Alex Dvornikov. I’m a Physics MS student at SDSU. I earned my BS in Astrophysics at UCSD. Why is there more matter than antimatter? What is dark matter? I'm trying to find out and I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.sandiego.edu/cas/physics/faculty-and-staff/biography.php?profile_id=769"> Chad Kishimoto</a>. I’m currently researching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino">sterile neutrinos</a>. Check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B68NezZCfz3mV3BLV3FQV1JzTjg">CV</a>. In short, I love physics &amp; teaching. Send me an <a href="mailto:alexdvornikov@yahoo.com?Subject=Hello,%20Alex!">email</a>. I’m also on <a href="https://500px.com/racoonciliation">500px</a> if you’re into photography.</p>
