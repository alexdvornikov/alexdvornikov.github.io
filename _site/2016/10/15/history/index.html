    <p>I grew up in a small mining town in Ukraine and I can boast of an inexplicably adventurous and free childhood.</p>

<p>I ran around barefoot on dusty trails, joined by my friends and stray dogs, surrounded by sunflowers and weeds three times my height. At nights, I listened to accordions and singing grandmas. I still recall some of the folk songs. I spent my happiest times splat in the middle of the largest Uranium ore in the Soviet Union. My school was built on the original precipice dug out in 1946. Next door, was an Orthodox Church, previously a communist theater. The mine itself now lies a mile underground. My most colorful memory is a trip to McDonalds at the provincial capital. My mom, who raised me alone, could not afford two orders, but we split a happy meal anyway. We felt like high rollers.</p>

<p>On a frigid winter night in 2003, -20 C, I bussed to Moscow. Then, I flew to Seattle, San Francisco, and finally Sacramento. The next day, I braced the Californian winter at a new school. I did not understand anything. The first year is literally erased from my mind through shell shock. After a year, the lights suddenly flickered on and my brain whirred in overdrive. I understood everything, laughed at the cartoons, and realized the awesomeness of my new world.</p>

<p>My biggest stroke of luck came in high school. The planets simply aligned. My school was across the street from an Intel factory and I was surrounded by unbelievably smart people. I had splendid teachers, undoubtedly some of the best in the state. They proved to me that anyone can learn anything and that math and science can be debilitating, lifelong obsessions. They stretched my mind and nudged me into the top ten in my graduating class.</p>

<p>I knew I was unbelievably fortunate and I wanted to give back. I joined and became a president of a community service club and spent my weekends volunteering. Some days I dressed like a tall elf and calmed down kids who feared the fat and drunk Santa. Other days, I lugged around equipment bags for marathon runners. Hefty bags were not news. I had invaluable experience dragging them around while working at a deli. In high school, I realized that I do not want to work at a cafe for the rest of my life and that I would rather use my mind to make a living.</p>

<p>The planets remained aligned and my second stroke of luck was my admission to the University of California, San Diego. In La Jolla, I met my lifelong friends and discovered my passions. I started out as an aerospace engineer, but after hearing all the how’s and not the why’s I switched to physics. I still have no idea about the why’s, but at least now I am trying to find out. Five years later, the why’s still bug me and I’m just as ecstatic to see someone else’s realizations as my own. There is no better feeling than to see someone grasp an idea; to see the first spark in someone’s eyes as a prelude to the fireworks. Since I graduated from UCSD, I have taught more than a dozen labs on electromagnetism, optics, atoms, and mechanics, and I live for these moments. Even though I have worked on my M.S. and tested the waters of scientific research in San Francisco and San Diego, I know that I have only scratched the surface. A lifetime is not enough. I spend an absurd amount of time self-learning; watching online lectures in India, Britain, and US. I am still fascinated by physics and I cannot imagine doing anything else.</p>

        <p>Hey, there. I’m Alex Dvornikov. I’m a Physics MS student at SDSU. Why is there more matter than antimatter? What is dark matter? I'm trying to find out and I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.sandiego.edu/cas/physics/faculty-and-staff/biography.php?profile_id=769"> Chad Kishimoto</a>. I’m currently researching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_neutrino">sterile neutrinos</a>. Check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B68NezZCfz3mV3BLV3FQV1JzTjg">CV</a>. In short, I love physics &amp; teaching. Send me an <a href="mailto:alexdvornikov@yahoo.com?Subject=Hello,%20Alex!">email</a>. I’m also on <a href="https://500px.com/racoonciliation">500px</a> if you’re into photography.</p>
